🐜 Random Ant Simulation
This project demonstrates a random control simulation of the Ant robot using MuJoCo and Brax. The Ant robot is a quadruped designed to move in complex environments. Instead of learning a policy, the simulation applies randomized control inputs to observe behavior and evaluate the dynamics of the environment.
